Problem Statement
Classifying fingerprints such that different impressions from the same finger fall into the same
group reduces the number of comparisons to the database during fingerprint matching. There are
5 significant types of human fingerprints to classify into (with 1 rare type), hence this is a
multiclass classification problem.
